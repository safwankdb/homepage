## Who am I?

I am Mohd Safwan, an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay, and a Computer Vision Engineer at [Augle AI](https://augle.ai). My interests are Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I love taking long walks and even longer naps. Reach out to me at [safwaniitb@gmail.com](mailto:safwaniitb@gmail.com). Know more about me [here](./about).

## Projects

Projects are good things, perhaps the best of things. In my experience, no good project ever gets completed. Here is a non-exhaustive [list of projects](./projects) I own or have contributed to. Apart from this, have a look at [my GitHub](https://safwankdb@github.io  ).

## Blog

This is my blog where I try to summarize my thoughts about all kinds of things. Having started recently, I will try to write more often.
