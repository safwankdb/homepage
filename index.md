- ## Who am I?

I am Mohd Safwan, a UG student at IIT Bombay, and Co-founder at [Augle AI](https://augle.ai). My interests are Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Reach out to me at [safwaniitb@gmail.com](mailto:safwaniitb@gmail.com) or connect with me at  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/safwankdb/). Know more about me [here](./about).

- ## Projects

Projects are good things, perhaps the best of things. In my experience, no good project ever gets completed. Here is a non-exhaustive [list of projects](./projects) I own or have contributed to. Apart from this, have a look at [my GitHub](https://github.com/safwankdb). You can find a short (probably outdated) [Resume here](./Resume.pdf).

- ## Blog

This is my [blog](./blog) where I try to summarize my thoughts about all kinds of things. Having started recently, I will try to write more often.
